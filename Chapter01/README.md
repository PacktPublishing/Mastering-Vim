# Mastering Vim - Chapter 1: Getting Started

## .vimrc

`.vimrc` is a configuration file which lives in your home directory.

If you're on Linux or Mac OS, copy `.vimrc` file to your `$HOME` directory, for
example `/home/ruslan/.vimrc`. If you're on Windows, rename the file to
`_vimrc` (Windows does not allow periods in file names) and place it in your
`%USERPROFILE%` directory, for example `C:\Users\ruslan\_vimrc`.

To find where your user directory is, open your command line (Terminal on Mac
OS and Linux, cmd.exe on Windows), and execute `echo $HOME` on Linux/Mac OS or
`echo %USERPROFILE%` on Windows.
